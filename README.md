# elphy

`elphy`, short for electron-phonon anharmonicity, is a C program to calculate
free energies and forces for tight-binding models on supercells, complemented
with linear electron-phonon coupling and a harmonic potential. It is a faster
rewrite of the Python module `elphmod.md` and thus primarily a driver for the
path-integral molecular-dynamics code i-PI. It is written in ANSI C (C89/C99).

## Installation

The following command compiles the program using GCC without optimization:

    make

Different compilers and optimization flags can be selected:

    make CC=icx CFLAGS=-O2

LAPACK and BLAS are required.

## Usage

The program is run as follows:

    elphy input.dat [input.xyz ...]

`input.dat` is defined below, where `[…]` are placeholders for numerical values.

    [R₀₀] [R₀₁] [R₀₂]

    [i₂] [α₂] [β₂] [<0 α₂|H|Rᵢ₂ β₂>]
    ⋮
    [number of interatomic force constants]
    [j₀] [x₀] [y₀] [∂²E/[∂u(0, x₀) ∂u(Rⱼ₀, y₀)]
    [j₁] [x₁] [y₁] [∂²E/[∂u(0, x₁) ∂u(Rⱼ₁, y₁)]
    [j₂] [x₂] [y₂] [∂²E/[∂u(0, x₂) ∂u(Rⱼ₂, y₂)]
    ⋮
    [number of electron-phonon matrix elements]
    [k₀] [z₀] [l₀] [γ₀] [δ₀] [<0 γ₀|∂H/∂u(Rₖ₀, z₀)|Rₗ₀ δ₀>]
    [k₁] [z₁] [l₁] [γ₁] [δ₁] [<0 γ₁|∂H/∂u(Rₖ₁, z₁)|Rₗ₁ δ₁>]
    [k₂] [z₂] [l₂] [γ₂] [δ₂] [<0 γ₂|∂H/∂u(Rₖ₂, z₂)|Rₗ₂ δ₂>]
    ⋮

The indices `i, j, k, l` run over lattice vectors, `α, β, γ, δ` over orbitals,
and `x, y, z` over the three Cartesian displacement directions for all atoms.
Primitive and position vectors `a` and `r` are given in Cartesian coordinates,
supercell and lattice vectors `A` and `R` in integer crystal coordinates.

No unit conversions are performed, so any consistent energy and length units can
be used. However, i-PI expects energies and forces in Hartree atomic units.

Note that the interatomic force constants are assumed to be partially screened:
They shall exclude the harmonic term of the electronic potential-energy surface.
Any forces that the model may generate at zero displacements are set to zero.

The i-PI socket address is a host name optionally followed by a colon and a port
number, e.g., `localhost:31415`. If the port number is omitted or zero, a UNIX
socket is used for communication, otherwise an internet socket. The address must
match the information in the i-PI input file `input.xml`.

It is possible to pass further command arguments `input.xyz ...`. In this case,
the program does not connect to a socket but prints for the atomic coordinates
in each XYZ file the corresponding free energies and forces to standard output.
Missing files are created for structures with small random displacements.

## Tests and examples

- `make input.dat` creates an example input file with data for graphene.
- `make test` verifies that the computed free energy and forces are correct.
- `make ipi` lets  `elphy` and i-PI perform a structural relaxation together.
  The files generated by i-PI can be cleaned up with `make clean_ipi`.
